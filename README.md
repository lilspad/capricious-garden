## Weaknesses

These are some of the things I've learnt I'll have to improve on in the future:

- Inefficient loading, large media
- Unconvential product display (plants)
- Poor accessibility - need media alt text, keyboard navigation
- No media queries, design could be more responsive
- Directory organisation could be more team friendly
